    "# General Statement\n",
    "- Modern technology is increasingly transforming agriculture in the 21st century.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In modern agriculture ,early detection of crop diseases is critical to ensuring food security and minimizing losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Due to the advanced technology,machine learning ie deep learning has become a powerful tool for automating the detection and classification of plant diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to predict rice leaf diseases based on image data inorder to help farmers and agriculture proffessionals take timely and effective action to mitigate crop losses"

    "- However, rice crops are highly susceptible to various diseases that significantly reduce yield and affect food supply.\n",
    "- This project aims to develop a deep learning _based model that can automatically classify images to rice leaves into different disease categories or healthy leaves  which traditional methods rely on manual inspection that is time consuming and iften inaccurate.\n",
    "- The model will assist in early detection of rice disease ,leading to timely interventions and improved crop management."
