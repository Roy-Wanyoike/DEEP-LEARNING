# DEEP-LEARNING

 #General Statement.
- Modern technology is increasingly transforming agriculture in the 21st century.

- In modern agriculture ,early detection of crop diseases is critical to ensuring food security and minimizing losses.

- Due to the advanced technology,machine learning ie deep learning has become a powerful tool for automating the detection and classification of plant diseases.

- This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to predict rice leaf diseases based on image data inorder to help farmers and agriculture proffessionals take timely and effective action to mitigate crop losses.
